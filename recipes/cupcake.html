        <p><h3>One of the worst foods you will ever eat.  They look and taste like some dude blew a load of cum on a cupcake.</p>
        

        <p>This will take approximately 1 hour to make and will serve up to 24 people.  Each cupcake has 124 calories and 9 grams of fat.  They are best served cold and need to be thawed out before they are to be eaten.</p>
