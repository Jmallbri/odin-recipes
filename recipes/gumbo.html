<p>Gumbo is one of the most famous dishes to result from Louisiana's shared Creole-Cajun heritage. Gumbo falls somewhere between a thick stew and a hearty soup and can contain ingredients such as chicken, sausage, ham, seafood, okra, tomatoes, and greens.</p>

<p><H3><div>How to Make Gumbo</div></H3></p>
<p>Great gumbo starts with roux, a flavorful thickening agent made from equal parts fat and flour. Once the roux is a deep golden color, add diced veggies and sausage to the mix. Then, incorporate beef bouillon, hot sauce, tomatoes, and seasonings to intensify the flavor.  Let the gumbo simmer for 45 minutes before adding file powder, okra, and seafood. The result will be a lusciously hearty stew packed with Creole spice.</p>

<p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>

<li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>¾ cup bacon drippings</li>
<li>1 cup coarsely chopped celery</li>
<li>1 large onion, coarsely chopped</li>
<li>1 large green bell pepper, coarsely chopped</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 pound andouille sausage, sliced</li>
<li>3 quarts water</li>
<li>6 cubes beef bouillon</li>
<li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
<li>salt to taste</li>
<li>2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®), or to taste</li>
<li>½ teaspoon Cajun seasoning blend (such as Tony Chachere's®), or to taste</li>
<li>4 bay leaves</li>
<li>½ teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
<li>1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>
<li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
<li>4 teaspoons file powder, divided</li>
<li>2 tablespoons bacon drippings</li>
<li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen cut okra, thawed</li>
<li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
<li>1 pound lump crabmeat</li>
<li>3 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
<li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>

<p><h4>Steps</h4></p>
<ol>
<li>Place celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables are very finely chopped. Stir vegetables into the roux, and mix in sausage. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside.</li>
<li>Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until bouillon cubes dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water.</li>
<li>Reduce heat to a simmer, and mix in sugar, salt, hot pepper sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes, and tomato sauce. Simmer soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in 2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a skillet over medium heat. Add okra and vinegar and cook for 15 minutes; remove okra with a slotted spoon, and stir into the simmering gumbo.</li>
<li>Mix in crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire sauce, and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more minutes. Stir in 2 more teaspoons of file gumbo powder just before serving.</li>
